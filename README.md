# Useless projects
Made by me, JIucu4ka, just because I was bored.<br>
You can use these freely to have fun or include in your project.<br><br>

## Here are currently included projects:
- **analogClock.ts** — a cool analog clock made with just symbols and using some math right in your console! Don't forget to change your `skew` value, because symbol heights can vary!<br>
- **miHoYoWishingSystem.ts** — I tried to recreate wishing system that miHoYo is using in their latest games and actually succeded on making it as close as possible. The results are practially the same as in game and there is even a guarantee system! Make sure to explore its code and understand how chances of getting rare characters work! I included a test function at the very bottom so make sure to have fun!<br>
- **sqrtTaylorSeries.ts** — a simple algorithm to approximately calculate a square root without Math.sqrt() function. This algorithm is being used practically everywhere and you can even use its formula to calculate high precision square roots of numbers on paper!<br>
